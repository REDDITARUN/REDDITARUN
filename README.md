Driven by a passion to use technology for a better world, I‚Äôm always eager to learn and experiment, embracing the vast possibilities of AI and Cyber Security. I also have a deep appreciation for creative designs. üé®

When I‚Äôm not neck-deep in neural nets or tweaking algorithms, you‚Äôll find me sharing my latest "Woah!" moments on my blog or tinkering with some design projects. Because I love creative designs - who doesn't?
