I love to build, experiment, and do a ton of research. Cause experimenting is never boring.
Things I want to and I’m experimenting on:

- Vision models, LLMs, TTS, STT
- Memory, context, or retrieval, etc.
- Kernels, kernel optimization, kernel code gen (*)
- RL (big big big fan). Also, I feel that’s where the future holds
  
Free time?
- Write blogs
- Do some creative stuff like designs
- Go for walks or rides
